## Recommendations 
1. Focus on high-performing product sub-categories like Binders to boost profits. Assess low-performing sub-categories and consider optimizing or phasing out underperforming ones to allocate resources efficiently. 
2. Focus on the East region to maximize profits in terms of location. Investigate reasons for underperformance in the South region and tailor marketing strategies to boost sales and profitability. 
3. Use monthly sales data to plan marketing campaigns strategically based on product seasonality and maintain/improve profit margins during high-sales months. 
4. Encourage cross-selling and upselling to increase overall sales amount. 
5. Target California, which had the highest sales, and allocate more resources and marketing efforts to penetrate the market further. 
6. Recognize and reward high-performing managers and provide support or training to managers with lower sales and profits to improve their performance. 
7. Address order returns to reduce return rates, boost profitability, and prioritize customer satisfaction. Implementing these recommendations can optimize sales and profitability.
